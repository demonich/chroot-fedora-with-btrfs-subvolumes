Bash script to make your life better
# About 
This script was created as an unversal solution to temporarily change the root directory of a disk, which is used mainly to solve problems with Linux operating system booting after an upgrade or incorrect user actions.
# WIP
It's just a preparation. The script should ask about bios mode, partitions, partition formats, and so on. Right now this script looks more like a guide, but not a script ready to run.
